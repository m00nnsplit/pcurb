Python CUrses Reddit Browser (PCURB) is supposed to be a curses interface in Python 3, ncurses and PRAW

PCURB is for reading comments and discussions, since images and links are somewhat harder to represent in a terminal environment. For these look up terminal-based browsers like Lynx or w3m instead. PCURB focuses on providing a more comfortable experience reading Reddit comments, not the entire Web.

### How to run
First, obviously, Python 3, [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and ncurses are required. I haven't run across any ncurses bindings for Python 3 on Windows, so I guess that's not an option.

Run it simply by typing ./pcurb in a terminal. You can pass it "help", "h" or "-h" to get a short help ; type a subreddit name as argument to open that subreddit (for instance, "./pcurb gifsofotters") ; like with regular reddit, they can be combined with "+".

-s or --sort followed by sort method will change the sort method. Choose from hot, new, rising, top-hr, top-dy, top-wk, top-mn, top-yr, top-al, con-hr, con-dy, con-wk, con-mn, con-yr, con-al.

### Usage

When looking at a subreddit, use the up and down arrow keys (or j and k) to scroll, or Q to quit.

Press M ("more"), then type a number, then press Enter and wait to see comments. Once there, use arrow keys (or j and k, or Pgup and Pdown) to scroll or press Q to quit.

Press O ("order") to get a small window to appear, then press the number of the mode (hot, new, top..) you want to change it.


### Current state

Usable, just lacking on features. Can only load the first page of anything.

#### To do

 - Mark OP in comments (integrate into flair) ; limit flair size depending on screen size.

 - Handle screen resizes dynamically ?

 - Manage (gasp) loading more pages of something

 - Manage sorting of comments

 - When changing order, scroll pad back to top
 
 - Allow jumping from top comment to top comment (like anchors)
